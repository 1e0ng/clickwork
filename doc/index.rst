Clickwork
=========

Clickwork helps you manage crowdsourcing of human intelligence tasks with your
own staff of workers. It is designed to make it simple to take data in, turn it
into work to be done by people, and generate results that can be used to feed
statistical analysis.

Clickwork helps you:

 1. load data sets
 2. define tasks on the data
 3. assign tasks to clickworkers
 4. save results

Clickwork is especially well suited to building groundtruth data sets for
training and evaluation of supervised machine learning systems.

For example, when building a search engine, one might want to have humans
manual "rate" different possible responses to large numbers of queries (10^3 to
10^6). Clickwork allows you to define such a job, assign it to many
workers (10^2 to 10^5), and save their inputs.
