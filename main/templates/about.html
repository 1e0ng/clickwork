<p>
Clickwork helps you manage crowdsourcing of human intelligence
tasks with your own staff of workers.  

It is designed to make it simple to take data in, turn it into work to be done
by people, and generate results that can be used to feed statistical analysis.
</p>

<p>Clickwork helps you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>load data sets</li>
  <li>define tasks on the data</li>
  <li>assign tasks to clickworkers</li>
  <li>save results</li>
</ol>

<p>Clickwork is especially well suited to building groundtruth data sets for 
training and evaluation of supervised machine learning systems.</p>

<p>For example, when building a search engine, one might want to have humans 
manual "rate" different possible responses to large numbers of queries 
(10^3 to 10^6).  Clickwork allows you to define such a job, assign it to 
many clickworkers (10^2 to 10^5), and save their inputs.</p>
